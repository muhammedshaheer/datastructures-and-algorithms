# DataStructures and Algorithms

## DataStructures(I)

* ### Stack
    * Time Complexity - O(1)
    * #### Applications
        * Reverse a word
        * Compilers to calculate value of an expression
        * Browsers to save previously visited urls

* ### Queue
    * Complexity = O(1)
    * #### Applications
        * CPU/Disk scheduling
        * Synchronisation
        * Call centre phone system to hold people calling them in order

* ### Circular Queue
    * Complexity = O(1)
    * #### Applications
        * CPU Scheduling
        * Memory Management
        * Traffic Management

* ### Deque
    * Complexity = O(1)
    * #### Applications
        * Undo operations
        * store history in browsers
        * implementing both stack and queue
